# Enchanted Golden Apple Finder

I promised I would release this when I reached 100 subscribers. Hah. Blew past that to almost 500 before I got around to finally bothering to upload this code. Mostly because this project became pretty much obsolete with the addition of ancient cities in 1.19, which are super easy to find with programs like chunkbase and they usually contain several enchanted golden apples each. But here it is. I'm not going to be actively maintaining this project in any way, shape, or form. You are on your own if you want to use it or update it to modern versions.

This project is setup for release 1.19, when I last updated it in 2023. You'll also need to install Fabric API and Baritone. To use the mod, use the /gapple command in-game.
